# Handle http requests with Tanstack Query

This is a practice project in which I practiced using react query to handle http requests. I simulated a 'backend' locally and fetched data from there.
It is a page for locating, adding and editing events.

Install dependencies
`npm install`

Start the backend:
`cd backend`
`npm start`

Start frontend:
`npm run dev`
